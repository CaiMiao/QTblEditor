3) Save user's table parameters - for example; everytime I load the program I have the key column covering all screen, and string column is not visible so I have to fix the columns everytime I open the program.

- save position for each opened file
- rewrite search
- different colors on one line mustn't be reversed, e.g. '\gold;Median XL by \dgreen;BrotherLaz'
- allow 'almost' synced tables (there can be a number of rows that doesn't match, but all others must match)
- allow Cut

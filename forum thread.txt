[cross-platform] QTblEditor - just another tbl editor
=====================================================

So this is just another tbl editor. It is written in C++ using Qt library, hence it's a cross-platform application.

Translation of Median XL inspired me to create this application. When I was translating tbl files, I found existing editors very inconvenient to use, so I decided to create my own that fits my needs. I hope someone'll find it useful too.

QTblEditor can run on any Windows version (starting from Win98), Mac OS X (Intel/PPC, starting from 10.5) and Linux (where Qt can be installed).

Windows and Mac OS X versions include binary, necessary Qt dynamic libraries (QtCore and QtGui) and russian translation. Source includes Visual Studio and QtCreator project files; requires Qt 4.6.0 or higher (v1.1 is compiled with 4.6.3, but 4.6.0 should do).

[b]Installation:[/b]
[list][*]Windows: unrar wherever you want and run exe
[*]Mac OS X: mount dmg and copy app bundle wherever you want (e.g., to /Applications)
[*]Linux: No idea[/list]

I placed some comments in the source code (mostly in the *.tbl file processing part), so that it'd be easier for one to understand how things work.
I haven't included any license information, but you may copy and modify the code as you wish, so I guess it's the GPL license. However, mentioning me in credits would be nice :)
